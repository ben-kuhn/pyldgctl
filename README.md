Python/GTK GUI control utility for LDG AT-1000ProII and AT-600ProII Automatic Antenna Tuners.

This is a reimplementation of https://github.com/Efpophis/LDGControl in Python/GTK.

This is also my first python/GTK GUI project so there is likely to be some experimental
files/code that don't make any sense outside of my playing around with examples.
